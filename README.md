# Catering
Assignment 3

OBJECTIVE:
The objective of the assignment is to write a C# GUI app using check boxes and
combo boxes from Windows Forms to create GUI objects.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Cindy’s catering provides meals for parties and special events. Create an
interactive GUI app that allows Cindy's Catering to better operate their business. The following data must be entered
concerning the customer and the event:

 The customer’s name must be entered into a text field.
 The customer’s contact phone number into a text field.
 The number of guests invited to a Cindy catered event into a text field.
 The customer must choose one entrée from a group of at least four choices.
 The customer must choose up to two side dishes from a group of at least four choices.
 The customer must choose one desert from a group of at least three choices.

The programmer can make the choices as s(he) desires.
Display the cost of the event that is calculated as $35 per person.
To validate the input data, do the following:

 If the value entered for the number of guest is not numeric, set the event price to zero.
 If the user attempts to choose more than two side dishes, remove all the current side dish selections so that the
user can start over.

After the final price for the dinner has been calculated, the event information must be saved to an output file so that
Cindy’s Catering will have the information for the event. The items should be separated by spaces. If any item is not
chosen, enter the word “none” for that item. The following fields must be written to the output file:

 the customer’s name
 the customer’s contact phone number
 the number of guests
 the one entrée chosen
 the two sides chosen
 the one desert chosen

Requirements:

 The data input must be done as a GUI using Windows Forms.
 The class should be named Catering.
 The output file should be named Event
 Submit program through the assignment tool in Canvas.
 Make use of fonts and colors where needed.
